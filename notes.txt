        MYSQL

first download mysql
then sql workbench makes it easier to managed things
then drop schema
create new schema
create name new table
'pk' for primary key to track data and 'ai' for auto incriment so it continues on its own 1 2 3 and so on
then title with 'nn' option for not null must have title and id 'VARCHAR' make it a string and can control character limits
next one is cover picture but can be null dont NEED image
it also shows code version for how u can do it in terminal workbench just makes it easier
* note if you see something not working download earlier version of it -_-
SELECT * FROM test.books; this is how we select all from this table gonna write it in app

        BACKEND 
      
then npm init -y
npm i express mysql nodemon 'installs express mysql and nodemon duh'
index.js create
* import express *cant use outside module so go to json and add module type   "type": "module",

then make a port to listen
then node index.js
* in scripts json add nodemomn so the server can auto update whenever anything is changed rather than having to restart it everytime     "start": "nodemon index.js"

* ISSUE WITH MYSQL 8 AND NODEJS SHIT FIX
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Execute the following query in MYSQL Workbench

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
Where root as your user localhost as your URL and password as your password
Then run this query to refresh privileges:
flush privileges;
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        FRONTEND
npm i react-router-dom
import {
    createBrowserRouter,
    RouterProvider,
